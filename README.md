# twitterSentimentAnalysis
In this project i have tried to solve the problem of classifying the tweets as positive or neagtive.
The dataset that i have used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140)
The steps I followed for this project are:
  1.Data cleaning
  2.Data visualisation
  3.Training different models like LSTM,tfidf+logistciRegression and Finetuning Bert.
  4.Deploying using streamlit.
I was able to achive 83% accuracy on training set and 80%accuracy on test set.
The whole approach can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/aditya01233/twitter)
